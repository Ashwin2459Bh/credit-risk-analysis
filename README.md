Credit Risk Analysis – Machine Learning Project
1. Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting credit risk using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to classify loan applicants as low-risk or high-risk, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model building and evaluation

Comparison of multiple algorithms

Final optimized model for credit risk prediction



2. Dataset Description

The dataset contains demographic, financial, and credit-related information.
Common features include:

Age

Income

Employment details

Loan amount

Credit history

Previous defaults

Target variable:

1 → High Risk

0 → Low Risk
